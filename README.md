## Description
 Advanced data representation functions for Owl Techâ€™s CPU design team
 
## Build Instructions
The build instructions were to create a convert.c and main.c,
In convert.c we would implement six functions:

oct_to_bin: Direct 3-bit octal to binary mapping
oct_to_hex: Octal to hexadecimal conversion
hex_to_bin: Direct 4-bit hex to binary mapping
to_sign_magnitude: Signed integer representation
to_ones_complement: One's complement representation
to_twos_complement: Two's complement representation

And in main.c we would reuse our main.c from assignment 1.

## Test Results
[Summary: 51/51 tests passed]
