## Description
 Advanced data representation functions for Owl Techâ€™s CPU design team
 
## Build Instructions
The build instructions were to create a convert.c and main.c.

In convert.c we would implement six functions:

oct_to_bin: Direct 3-bit octal to binary mapping

oct_to_hex: Octal to hexadecimal conversion

hex_to_bin: Direct 4-bit hex to binary mapping

to_sign_magnitude: Signed integer representation

to_ones_complement: One's complement representation

to_twos_complement: Two's complement representation


And in main.c we would reuse our main.c from assignment 1.

## Test Results
[Summary: 51/51 tests passed]
Everything matches.

Ps. It was said that there were 60 tests but I double checked, there are only 51.
